## Usage

### Install and enable environment

```bash
virtualenv tabularbackdoor
source tabularbackdoor/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# To run the notebooks you also need:
pip install notebook
```

### Download and preprocess data

1. Download `accepted_2007_to_2018Q4.csv` from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wordsforthewise/lending-club and place in `data/LOAN/`
2. Download `LCDataDictionary.xlsx` from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adarshsng/lending-club-loan-data-csv?select=LCDataDictionary.xlsx and place in `data/LOAN/`
3. Download `HIGGS.csv.gz` from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/HIGGS and extract `HIGGS.csv` to `data/HIGGS`
4. Run all four notebooks under `data/preprocess` to generate the `.pkl` files containing the datasets for the experiments

### Run main experiments

Run the shell script in any of the `Exp*` folders from the project root with the Python filename (without extension) as argument. Output will be logged to the output folder.

- NOTE: starting an experiment will override the previous log file of the same experiment.
- NOTE: depending on the machine, you might want to edit the GPU used to train each model. To do so, edit the `cuda:x` string (located somewhere on top) in each `.py` file.

Example:
```bash
bash ExpTriggerSize/run_experiment.sh TabNet_CovType_1F_OOB
```

To live view the log of a running experiment, use `tail -f` with the logfile as argument in a new terminal:

```bash
tail -f output/triggersize/TabNet_CovType_1F_OOB.log
```

### View results of main experiments

Output logs are found in the `output/` folder. All logs end with a section `EASY COPY PASTE RESULTS:` where you can copy the resulting lists containing the `ASR` and `BA` for each run.

### Run notebooks (Defences and FeatureImportance calculations)

See the `Notebooks/` folder for other (smaller or parts of) experiments in the form of notebooks. To run the defences, you must first run the appropiate `CreateModel` Notebook to create a backdoored model and dataset which can then be analyzed with the other Notebooks. For Fine-Pruning defence, there is a dedicated subfolder in the `Notebooks/Defences` folder with notebooks to train, prune and finetune FTT.
